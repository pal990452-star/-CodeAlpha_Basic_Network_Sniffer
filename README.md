# 📖 Overview

Basic Network Sniffer is an educational Python application that captures live network packets and displays useful information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, ports, and packet payloads. It provides hands-on experience with packet sniffing, protocol analysis, and network monitoring while helping users understand how data travels across a network.

---

# ✨ Features

* 📡 Live packet capture
* 🌐 Source & destination IP detection
* 🔍 TCP, UDP, ICMP and ARP packet identification
* 🌍 DNS packet analysis
* 📦 Packet payload inspection
* 📊 Real-time packet statistics
* 💾 Export captured data to JSON and TXT
* 📁 Analyze PCAP files
* 🎨 Colorized command-line interface
* 🖥️ Network interface detection
* ⚡ Lightweight and beginner-friendly

# ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pal990452-star/-CodeAlpha_Basic_Network_Sniffer.git
cd  -CodeAlpha_Basic-Network-Sniffer
ls
cd Source
ls
python sniffer.py
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

# ▶️ Usage

Run the sniffer:

```bash
sudo python3 src/main.py
```

Analyze a PCAP file:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --analyze capture.pcap
```

List available network interfaces:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --interfaces
```
